A fantastic web-based music creation and production tool that was created for a university project is the Music Maker. This comprehensive application includes a wide range of functions meant to make the process of creating, editing, and recording music tracks as simple as possible. This project stands out not only for its amazing functionality but also for its usability and accessibility, which adapts to desktop and mobile contexts with ease. Moreover, the music maker amazingly works with popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Javascript was used to offer interaction and control music, HTML to organize the webpage and CSS for styling. The Mediarecorder API was used to allow users to record audio through a microphone. Users are able to experiment with music composition utilizing a combination of these tools and technologies. The webpage can be hosted locally or remotely and is available through web browsers.
